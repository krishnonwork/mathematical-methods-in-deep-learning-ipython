    "## Inception\n",
    "\n",
    "The Inception V1 architecture was an important milestone in the development of CNN classifiers. Before its inception, the common idea to improve Deep Neural Networks was to try and stack more layers, hoping for better performance. The main hallmark of this architecture is the improved utilization of the computing resources inside the network. This was achieved by a carefully crafted design that allows for increasing the depth and width of the network while\n",
    "keeping the computational budget constant. Details can be found at https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.4842v1\n",

    "\n",
    "One of the most straightforward way of improving the performance of deep neural networks is by increasing their size. This includes both increasing the depth: the number of levels – of the network and its width: the number of units at each level.  However blindly increasing the depth and width often leads to overfitting because of the increase in the number of parameters. Additionally, it also increases the computation resources needed to train and deploy the neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Inception network was heavily engineered. It used a lot of tricks to push performance; both in terms of speed and accuracy. There have been several stages of improvement: Inception_v1, Inception_v2, Inception_v3, Inception_ResNet etc. "

    "Here we will consider the main idea behind Inception_V1, the first Inception architecture that started it all. \n",
    "\n",
    "Prior deep learning architectures typically stacked convolutional filters in a sequential manner i.e each layer applies a set of convolutional filters of same size, and passes it on to its subsequent layer.  The kernel size of the filter at each layer depended on the architecture. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, how do we know that we have chosen the right kernel size at each layer? \n",
    "Intuitively, we expect huge variation in the information. Thus, a larger kernel is preferred for information that is distributed more globally, and a smaller kernel is preferred for information that is distributed more locally. By being forced to choose one kernel size, the resulting architecture may not be optimal.  This is the problem that Inception v1 tried to solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "This was done by using an Inception module. The idea is to have wider layers that allowed for multiple filter sizes at the same level. \n",

    "The naive implementation of the Inception module performs convolutions on the input using 3 different kernel sizes (1x1, 3x3, 5x5). Additionally, max pooling is also performed. The outputs are concatenated, and sent into the next inception module. "
